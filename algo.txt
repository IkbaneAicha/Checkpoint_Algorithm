Algorithm AnalyzeSentence
    Input: sentence (a string ending with a period)
    Output: length (integer), word_count (integer), vowel_count (integer)

    // Initialize counters
    Set length to 0
    Set word_count to 1
    Set vowel_count to 0
    Set vowels to "aeiouAEIOU"

    // Process characters in sentence
    For each character in sentence Do
        If character = '.' Then
            Break
        
        Increment length by 1
        
        If character is in vowels Then
            Increment vowel_count by 1
        
        If character = ' ' Then
            Increment word_count by 1
    End For

    //results

    Return length, word_count, vowel_count
End Algorithm
